## Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

### Before You Begin

## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure 
for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, 
each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on 
the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to 
implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials 
have a number of questions on the program, so our first task on the job
is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task

**Aggregating the data found in the 
Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.** 

**Designing 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). 
You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may
 merge multiple datasets from different periods.** 

**The following are some questions to tackle.

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual 
subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
(Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
(Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
(Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey 
(Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over 
the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the
 timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Next, as a chronic over-achiever:**

* Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design 
a dashboard for each phenomena.
* The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining 
why the phenomena may be occuring. 

**The the following visualizations will be also created:**

* **Basic:** A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication 
of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data 
overlaid on top.

**Finally, create your final presentation**

* A Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested 
maps, and dashboards will be created.
